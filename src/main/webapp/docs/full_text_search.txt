1. New table: 
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200),
    body TEXT,
    FULLTEXT (title,body)
);
2. Modify an existing table: ALTER TABLE place ADD FULLTEXT(title, information);
3. Use cases:
 SELECT title, information FROM place WHERE MATCH(title, information) AGAINST('hoc bong');
 
 SELECT title, information FROM place WHERE MATCH(title, information) AGAINST('+hoc bong -Israel' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
 
4. A couple points about Full-Text searching in MySQL:
- Searches are not case sensitive
- Short words are ignored, the default minimum length is 4 characters. You can change the min and max word length with the variables ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len
- Words called stopwords are ignored, you can specify your own stopwords, but default words include the, have, some - see default stopwords list. 
- You can disable stopwords by setting the variable ft_stopword_file to an empty string.
- Full Text searching is only supported by the MyISAM storage engine.
- If a word is present in more than 50% of the rows it will have a weight of zero. This has advantages on large datasets, but can make testing difficult on small ones.

5. Set minimum number of keywords
- locate mysql directory: 
mysql> select @@basedir;
+------------------+
| @@basedir        |
+------------------+
| /usr/local/mysql |
+------------------+
1 row in set (0,00 sec)

- Edit file /usr/local/mysql/my.cnf
  > show variables like 'ft_min%';
 add line: 	[mysqld] ft_min_word_len=3
 
 sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
 [mysqld]
ft_min_word_len = 3

SET GLOBAL ft_min_word_len=3;
ALTER TABLE place ENGINE=MyISAM;
REPAIR TABLE place QUICK;

Difference Between InnoDB and MyISAM

January 10, 2008 at 1:41 pm · Filed under INODB, MySQL	·Tagged Database, Innodb, Myisam, MySQL	

    The big difference between MySQL Table Type MyISAM and InnoDB is that InnoDB supports transaction
    InnoDB supports some newer features: Transactions, row-level locking, foreign keys
    InnoDB is for high volume, high performance

Most people use MyISAM if they need speed and InnoDB for data integrity. You can use more than one or any combination of these table types in your database. Remember to asses the needs of your application before building it. Even though MyISAM is faster than InnoDB in the MySQL world, InnoDB is fast compared to any database engine.With InnoDB you get transactions, speed and integrity three features not usually used in the same sentence.

InnoDB has been designed for maximum performance when processing large data volumes. Its CPU efficiency is probably not matched by any other disk-based relational database engine.

Fully integrated with MySQL Server, the InnoDB storage engine maintains its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main memory. InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which may consist of several files (or raw disk partitions). This is different from, for example, MyISAM tables where each table is stored using separate files. InnoDB tables can be of any size even on operating systems where file size is limited to 2GB.

So, what do you think about those engines?? Please feel free to discuss it.
