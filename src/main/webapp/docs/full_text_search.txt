1. New table: 
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200),
    body TEXT,
    FULLTEXT (title,body)
);
2. Modify an existing table: ALTER TABLE place ADD FULLTEXT(title, information);
3. Use cases:
 SELECT title, information FROM place WHERE MATCH(title, information) AGAINST('hoc bong');
 
 SELECT title, information FROM place WHERE MATCH(title, information) AGAINST('+hoc bong -Israel' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
 
4. A couple points about Full-Text searching in MySQL:
- Searches are not case sensitive
- Short words are ignored, the default minimum length is 4 characters. You can change the min and max word length with the variables ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len
- Words called stopwords are ignored, you can specify your own stopwords, but default words include the, have, some - see default stopwords list. 
- You can disable stopwords by setting the variable ft_stopword_file to an empty string.
- Full Text searching is only supported by the MyISAM storage engine.
- If a word is present in more than 50% of the rows it will have a weight of zero. This has advantages on large datasets, but can make testing difficult on small ones.
