1. Folder structure
The jsp templates are stored in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp, and the files will end with .jsp. 
The reason why it's inside WEB-INF is because all the contents of webapp/ are visible by default 
to the world, except for this directory. So, for example, the file webapp/test.jsp could be 
accessed from the browser on http://localhost:8080/test.jsp in a textual form and it may cause a 
security problem or laughter. For other static resources like JavaScript files or images, that's 
of course a very desired behaviour.
